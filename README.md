The dataset contains data for 887 of the real Titanic passengers. Each row represents one person. The columns describe different attributes about the person including whether they survived (S), their age (A), their passenger-class (C), their sex (G) and the fare they paid (X). The table below shows the Data Dictionary.

In this program I answer several question, that is :
1. What is the dimension (col, row) of the data frame?
2. How to know data type of each variable?
3. How many passengers survived (Survived=1) and not-survived (Survived=0)?
4. How to drop column ‘Name’ from the data frame?
5. Add one new column called ‘family’ to represent number of family-member aboard (hint: family = sibsp + parch)
6. As shown, columns ‘Age’ contains missing values. Please add new column named ‘Age_miss’ to indicate whether Age is missing or not (Age_miss = ‘YES’ for missing value and ‘NO’ for non-missing value). 
7. Please fill Age missing value with means of existing Age values
8. What is the maximum passenger Age who survived from the tragedy? 
9. How many passengers survived from each ‘PClass’? 
10.How to randomly split the data frame into 2 parts (titanic1 and titanic2) with proportion of 0.7 for tttanic1 and 0.3 for titanic2 ?

That question is used to explore titanic data. Data wrangling is the process of cleaning and unifying messy and complex data sets for easy access and analysis. With the amount of data and data sources rapidly growing and expanding, it is getting more and more essential for the large amounts of available data to be organized for analysis.
This process typically includes manually converting/mapping data from one raw form into another format to allow for more convenient consumption and organization of the data.
